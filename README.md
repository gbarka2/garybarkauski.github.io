## Project Description

This website is an exhibition of my skills as a web developer, complete with links to my projects and course exercises to display my knowledge and expertise in my field. Included in the display at this time are examples of my CSS styling, jQuery manipulation, and framework usage. These examples are not intended to be static, and will evolve over time as skills, frameworks, and methods are adopted by myself.
